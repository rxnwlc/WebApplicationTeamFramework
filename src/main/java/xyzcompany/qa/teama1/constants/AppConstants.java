If you do not identify yourself as a Member at the time of purchase, you may upload on the “My Account” page on the Website or App a valid receipt for that purchase and it will count as a Qualifying Purchase so long as: (i) you were a Member at the time of purchase; and (ii) such purchase was made during the preceding 30 days. These benefits vary according to each tier listed below (a “Tier”):, Guaranteed benefits for each Tier are shown below:, When your Qualifying Purchases make you eligible for a Tier, you will receive benefits for that Tier during: (i) the Program Period in which you qualify; and (ii) the next Program Period. If you process a return or an order cancellation that drops your Qualifying Purchases below the level required for your current Tier, you will retain your Tier during that Program Period, but will be placed in the appropriate Tier during the next Program Period (based on your Qualifying Purchases at the end of the prior Program Period). Below are more details about these benefits: 1. Pro Xtra Perks. Pro Xtra Perks is a benefit of the Program which enables Members to earn rewards (“Perks”) on up to $1,000,000 of Qualifying Purchases in any Program Period (the “Qualifying Purchase Cap”). You may earn an initial Perk if your Qualifying Purchases exceed the first minimum threshold of $2,500 and additional Perks if you meet higher thresholds (as described on your Perks Page in MyAccount) during each Program Period (limit one Perk per threshold, each Perk threshold may be met once per Program Period, and Qualifying Purchases during each Program Period do not carry over to the next succeeding year). (a) Earning Perks. In order to earn Perks, you must identify yourself as a Member when making a Qualifying Purchase either by (i) using your Pro Xtra Virtual ID or Pro Xtra ID, or any Registered Tender, or (ii) logging onto your Member account online. Qualifying Purchases (i) used to earn Perks may not be applied to retroactive transactions and may only be applied to one Member account (and may not be combined with any other Member account), (ii) using a Registered Tender will be applied to the original Member account to which the Registered Tender is registered (even if that Registered Tender is subsequently moved to another Member account); and (iii) may also be tracked by adding a receipt to a Program account if the receipt is dated after benefit enrollment and not tracked in another Program account. • Using Pro Xtra Credit Card. The portion of any Qualifying Purchases made with a valid The Home Depot Commercial Revolving Charge Card (also known as the Pro Xtra Credit Card) that is a Registered Tender will receive credit for four (4) times your Qualifying Purchases for purpose of calculating Perks (e.g., a Qualifying Purchase of $1,000 will count as $4,000), up to the Qualifying Purchase Cap. (b) Selecting Perks. After meeting a minimum Perk threshold, Members have 90 days to select available Perks. Perk selections are final. Perks have an expiration date shown on the Member’s Perks Page in MyAccount; provided that Tool Rental Perks and Pro Xtra Dollars have expiration dates described below. (c) Other. Perks cannot be returned or exchanged and are non-transferable. If a Member returns a product which causes its Qualifying Purchases to fall below the level required to earn a Perk which has already been selected or delivered, the Member may retain that Perk, and the amount of such return (net of taxes and delivery charges) will be added to the Qualifying Purchase target level required to earn the next level Perk. Home Depot may test new Perks from time-to-time (see additional details on your Perks Page in MyAccount). Below is additional information about specific Perks: • Tool Rental Perks: Tool Rental Perks may be redeemed to pay rental charges for eligible tools at The Home Depot Rental Centers in the United States (including territories). To redeem, please present valid Pro Xtra ID and Tool Rental Perk barcode from The Home Depot App. Discount will be applied when tool is returned, and contract is closed. Tool Rental Perks may not be applied to pay for: (i) rental deposits, cleaning fees, salvage fees, repair charges, fuel charges, Revenue Recovery (fees charged when a rental goes into collections), Damage Protection, or used equipment sales; (ii) rental charges for Penske vehicles, Load-N-Go’s, HD Moving vehicles, and Trailers; (iii) large equipment delivered to the customer; or (iv) additional items which are not covered by a rental contract. Tool Rental Perks selected on and after July 29, 2020 expire 12 months after selection (Tool Rental Perks chosen before that date expire 180 days after selection). One Tool Rental Perk may be used per rental contract, and any unused Tool Rental Perks are not redeemable for cash or credit. Expired, lost or misdirected Tool Rental Perks cannot be reissued. • Pro Xtra Dollars: Pro Xtra customers may receive Pro Xtra Dollars, which are The Home Depot Digital Reward Cards that may be used to purchase merchandise and services at the Authorized Channels (and at The Home Depot stores in Canada). Pro Xtra Dollars can be redeemed in-store by presenting a mobile barcode from the Available Perks section in the Home Depot App or smartphone browser. Mobile barcodes frequently refresh to prevent misuse and fraud. During online checkout, you will be presented with the option to apply any available Pro Xtra Dollars to your transaction. To view your Pro Xtra Dollars balance, visit the “Cards & Accounts” page of your Pro Xtra account. Pro Xtra Dollars (i) are issued digitally and may not be converted into physical cards, (ii) are not a credit/debit card and are not redeemable for cash or credit unless required by law, and (iii) cannot be applied to any credit or loan balance, Tool Rental deposits or contracts, or for in-home purchases, or used to purchase The Home Depot or any third-party gift cards. Expired, lost or misdirected Pro Xtra Dollars cannot be reissued. Returns for purchases made with Pro Xtra Dollars subject to The Home Depot’s Returns Policy (details available at any The Home Depot store), and eligible refunds will be issued in store credit. For cross-border redemptions, Pro Xtra Dollars are redeemable at The Home Depot’s applicable local currency exchange rate at the time of redemption. Pro Xtra Dollars issued by Home Depot Incentives, Inc. Pro Xtra Dollars selected on and after September 29, 2020 expire 12 months after selection. 2. Personalized Offers. The Home Depot may conduct sweepstakes and other promotions (\"Promotions\") for Members, which will be governed by official rules. Your participation in a Promotion will constitute your acceptance of such official rules. The Home Depot may also send Members exclusive coupons for qualifying product purchases. Finally, you may qualify for personalized offers, discounts, benefits, and/or other rewards based upon your Program engagement and/or membership type. 3. Pro Xtra Paint Rewards. For a description of Pro Xtra Paint Rewards, see Section B.1. below. 4. Tier Achievement Gift. When you reach the Elite Tier or VIP Tier, you will receive a gift (a “Tier Achievement Gift”) of Pro Xtra Dollars which may be used for purchases in Authorized Channels. Your Tier Achievement Gift will be based upon your Program engagement and/or membership Tier status. Tier Achievement Gifts will be automatically deposited in a Member’s account and displayed in the “Offers” section. Members are entitled to receive up to two Tier Achievement Gifts per Annual Period (one at the Elite Tier and one at the VIP Tier). Tier Achievement Gifts will expire 12 months after issuance date. 5. Exclusive Sales and Events. You may receive access to exclusive sales and events based on your Tier status or your Program engagement and/or membership type. These sales and events may be unique, one-time events and may therefore vary during any Annual Period (and in different Annual Periods). Any communication we send you about these sales will describe any unique terms which apply. 6. Preferred Pricing. Preferred Pricing is a benefit of the Program which provides Elite and VIP Members with better-than-shelf pricing (“Preferred Pricing”) on select, in-stock items at the Authorized Channels. To receive Preferred Pricing, Elite and VIP Member(s) must: (i) scan their Pro Xtra Virtual ID or enter their Pro Xtra ID at time of any in-store purchase; or (ii) be logged onto an eligible Member account when placing an online order. No retroactive discounts will be given on purchases where a Member’s Pro Xtra ID was not entered prior to completing the sales transaction. Preferred Pricing: (x) can only be applied to online orders for in-store stocked product delivered through certain fulfillment channels; and (y) may not be combined with any other promotion or coupon and does not apply to prior purchases. Government customers who use The Home Depot’s Rapid Pass program will not receive Preferred Pricing. In addition, eligible government customers may opt-out of Preferred Pricing. 7. Business Tools. You may access online and in-store tools to help you manage and grow your business, including creating quotes; viewing and tracking your purchase history; participating in the Path to Pro Network; using the Pro Online Experience business tools; and enabling Text2Confirm to approve or decline your team’s in-store purchases with texts. 8. Elite Support Line. When you reach the Elite Tier or VIP Tier, you will have access to dedicated support lines (e.g., telephone, chat, and texting) for prioritized support. 9. VIP Experiences. When you reach the VIP Tier, you will be eligible to receive invitations to special events and experiences (subject to availability). Check with your account management resource to inquire about this benefit. 10. Account Management. Members who reach the VIP Tier will receive direct access to account management services from our experts, who are available to provide personalized onsite, in-store, or virtual support for your business. In order to access this support after you qualify, if you are not already receiving account management services, please contact us at ProXtraLoyaltyVIP@homedepot.com and ask to be contacted by our account management team, who will connect you with the appropriate resource(s)., B. Other Member Benefits. 1. Pro Xtra Paint Rewards. Pro Xtra Paint Rewards is a benefit of the Program. Pro Xtra Paint Rewards is valid for purchases at participating Authorized Channels. See your local The Home Depot store for product exclusion details. Members participating in Pro Xtra Paint Rewards will receive a discount on Qualifying Paints (referred to as the “Paint Discount”). The amount of your Paint Discount depends upon your membership level, which is based on your Qualifying Purchases (as shown in the chart below); provided that Elite Members are automatically enrolled at the Bronze membership level, and VIP Members are automatically enrolled at the Gold membership level. • “Qualifying Paints” means a Member’s purchases of liquid paint, stains, solvent, and primer in a one-gallon (or larger) container. • “Qualifying Purchases” for Pro Xtra Paint Rewards means a Member’s purchases of any paint department supplies (not just Qualifying Paints) at the Authorized Channels. Each membership level and its Paint Discount is shown in the following chart:, Qualifying Purchases will be tracked during the Program Period. Pro Xtra Paint Rewards Qualifying Purchases will not be tracked or accrued unless and until you have completed the registration requirements and you are currently in active status. In order to receive a Paint Discount applicable to your membership level, you must scan your Pro Xtra Virtual ID or provide your Pro Xtra ID prior to completing a sales transaction. (See Section IV. (REGISTRATION AND ELIGIBILITY), Subsection C. (Identification) below for more information about the Pro Xtra Virtual ID and Pro Xtra ID.) No retroactive discounts will be given on purchases where a Member’s Pro Xtra Virtual ID or Pro Xtra ID was not entered prior to completing the sales transaction. Your Paint Discount level will increase as your Qualifying Purchases accrue from one level to another, or by reaching Elite or VIP membership levels. The applicable amount of accrued spend will be deducted from a Pro Xtra Paint Rewards Member's account for returned Pro Xtra Paint Rewards Qualifying Purchases. If there is a zero or insufficient accrued spend total for the Pro Xtra Paint Rewards Member at the time of the return, the Pro Xtra Paint Rewards Member’s account will enter a negative status. In the event a Pro Xtra Paint Rewards Member fails to meet the minimum Pro Xtra Paint Rewards Qualifying Purchase amount during any Program Period, The Home Depot reserves the right to remove such Pro Xtra Paint Rewards Member from Pro Xtra Paint Rewards. Paint Discounts cannot be combined with other offers or paint promotions. Pro Xtra Paint Rewards purchases will not qualify for discounts through the Volume Pricing Program or any other program. Tool Rental merchandise, installations and gift cards are not eligible for a Paint Discount., 2. Pro Online Experience. Members also qualify for Pro Online Experience, which is a benefit of the Program. Pro Online Experience provides Members with all the advantages of the Program, plus additional, exclusive benefits, including: • The ability to create and save quotes, and lock in pricing on such quotes for up to seven days. • The ability to designate a “Purchaser” on your account who may place orders using your Registered Tender. • The ability to designate an “Administrator” on your account who may place orders, manage your account (including adding or editing users and payment methods, managing purchases and account information, and establishing online spend limits for purchasers), and view and redeem Perks. • Enhanced online tools, including the flexibility to export purchase history to QuickBooks®. 3. Text2Confirm. As part of the Program, you may join The Home Depot Text2Confirm program to receive automated text messages requesting approval of in-store purchases. By joining The Home Depot Text2Confirm program, you are agreeing to the following terms and conditions: • Text2Confirm text messages are sent by or on behalf of The Home Depot via automated technology to the mobile phone number you provide. • A telephone number may only be associated with one The Home Depot online account for Text2Confirm in-store purchase approval. • You agree to receive text messages requesting approval of in-store purchases made on your behalf using your designated credit/debit card.

The number of text messages you receive will depend on the number of such purchase authorization requests. • Standard text message and data rates apply.

To register in the Program, visit the Authorized Channels and complete the registration process, and read and agree to these Terms. Your primary telephone number will be your Program identification number (“Pro Xtra ID”). A telephone number and valid email address may only be associated with one online account (including your Pro Xtra account). B. Eligibility. The Program is available only to professional customers of The Home Depot who have fully completed the registration process (The Home Depot may share your information with third party vendors to verify you are a professional customer). The Program is intended for professional customers purchasing products for use in their business, and resellers are expressly excluded from the Program. (A reseller means an individual or company who purchases products and sells those products to third parties instead of using the products in its business.) We reserve the right to prohibit sales to resellers and to suspend any Member engaging in reseller activities. Government and municipal customers who purchase from The Home Depot under the U.S. Communities (now OMNIA Partners, Public Sector) Government Purchasing Alliance, or other government contracts, are ineligible to participate in certain elements of the Program, including receiving Perks, Tier Achievement Gifts, or other benefits based upon your government contract. Providing false information or omitting requested information may be grounds for denial of enrollment, accrual of Qualifying Purchases, and/or suspension of membership. C. Identification. To identify as Pro Xtra during in-store checkout, Pro Xtra ID can be entered or can be scanned from The Home Depot App or smartphone mobile browser (“Pro Xtra Virtual ID”).

Any Registered Tender can only be registered (and spend accrued) to one Pro Xtra account. Gift cards purchased from a third party or gift card reseller that are Registered Tender can only be removed by the owner of that account (any attributed spend tied to those gift cards cannot be separated from the Registered Tender and moved to another account). Members may request a Key Tag card to track Qualifying Purchases made with cash, gift card or store credit; however, the Key Tag card must be registered and presented to a The Home Depot associate prior to completing a sales transaction. Qualifying Purchase history will not be tracked unless and until you have completed the registration requirements set forth herein. D. Managing Qualifying Purchases. You may access your Program account, including reviewing your Qualifying Purchase history, by logging onto “My Account” on the Website or the App. Products and services that are eligible to count toward Qualifying Purchases are subject to change from time to time at The Home Depot’s discretion. A Member using a Registered Tender may track Qualifying Purchases retroactively; provided, however, that discounts shall not be applied to purchases made prior to Program registration. When making a Qualifying Purchase, if you fail to (i) scan your Pro Xtra Virtual ID or enter your Pro Xtra ID, (ii) be logged into a qualifying Pro Xtra account, or (iii) use any Registered Tender, you may have such sales transaction added to your history by following the instructions below within 120 days of the sales transaction: • Call us to speak with a Pro Xtra Customer Care Center representative (\"Customer Service\") for the Program. Email a copy of the Qualifying Purchase receipt and the Member’s Pro Xtra ID directly to the attention of the Customer Service representative with whom the Member spoke during the call to info@hdprosupport.com; or • Log into the Member’s online account and follow the instructions to add the receipt details E. Program Period. The Home Depot may, in its sole and exclusive discretion, designate different Program Periods. Accrued spend reached by each Member during a Program Period expires each year at 12:01 a.m. ET on January 1 of the succeeding Program Period. The Qualifying Purchases Minimum Threshold reached by each Member at the end of an applicable Program Period determines the Member’s Tier status and benefits during the next Program Period. Spending in subsequent Program Periods must exceed the Qualifying Purchase Minimum Threshold level of the previous year’s applicable Program Period to maintain Paint Discount and/or Rewards Discount levels in the next annual Program Period. F. Inactivation/Suspension. You may inactivate your membership at any time by contacting us. In addition, The Home Depot reserves the right to suspend any Member at any time in its sole discretion. During any period while you are inactive or suspended, you will not receive any membership benefits and will lose the benefits of any Tier.
